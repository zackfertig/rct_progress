# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.1 — 2025-10-29
- Fix: Avoid 10× inflated company values when using `--css0` by not re-scaling already-internal units.
- CSV path now requires `company_value` in internal units (display ×10); the previous CSV scaling option has been removed.
